<h1>------------ Event Registration ------------</h1>

<p>It was required to make this system of registration of events in my town </p>
<p>The task also requires you to register the user's personal data. </p>
<p> I made this version of the code with ChatGPT helps and it's a simple  version but I hope in the future to make the interface either.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The solution must be developed within the object-oriented paradigm;</li>
    <li>Optionally the project can be organized in a GIT repository;</li>
    <li>The use of architectural patterns such as MVC is not mandatory, but strongly encouraged;</li>
    <li>The structuring of a class diagram is mandatory, but desired;</li>
    <li>The project must be developed in Console;</li>
    <li>Must implement a system for registering and notifying events that are occurring in the city where the student lives;</li>
    <li>The system must provide a space for user registration. You must define the user attributes, which must be at least 3 (the more complete, the better);</li>
    <li>It must be possible to register events, defining a time (among other attributes). These events must have the following attributes: name, address, category, time and description;</li>
    <li>You must define the categories for creating events (parties, sporting events, shows, among other examples);</li>
    <li>It must be possible to consult the registered events and decide to participate in any that are listed;</li>
    <li>Likewise, it must be possible to view the events in which the user's presence has been confirmed and where it is possible to cancel participation;</li>
    <li>Using the time, the program must order the closest events and inform whether an event is occurring at the moment (it is desirable to use the DateTime structure to control times);</li>
    <li>The system must also inform events that have already occurred;</li>
    <li>Event information must be saved in a text file called events.data;</li>
    <li>Every time the program is opened, it must load events from reading this file;</li>
    
  </ul>
